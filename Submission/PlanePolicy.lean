# G2 — the plane win in the board's vocabulary (`Policy`, `playState`, `HasSnaky`)

`Snaky.Plane17.plane_snaky_wins_in_20` is a game-tree statement.  This file repackages it in
`OAI.SnakyPrototype.OrdinaryStrategy`'s `playState` form against the challenge `Model`:

* `cardStrategy get` — an explicit **total** policy: play the placed card's prescribed cell when
  some verified card of height ≤ rounds-left is placed with a fresh `p`; otherwise play any
  fresh cell (the "extra stone" of the card proof).  Freshness everywhere:
  `cardStrategy_fresh`.
* `cardStrategy_wins_20` — against every `LegalRepliesBeforeFinal` Breaker sequence, the final
  Maker set contains a Snaky: `HasSnaky (playState … 20).1`.

The invariant is the card induction of `Snaky.Plane`: at round `k` either a snaky is already on
board or a verified card of height `≤ 20 - k` is placed.  The final Breaker reply (`β 19`) is
deliberately unrestricted and never needed: a height-1 verified card is already won after the
move (its pass hint would point at a height-0 card, contradicting `cardOK`'s `1 ≤ h`).

What remains for G3/G4: the `Disjoint`/card-count conjuncts of `Bound` (they follow from this
policy's freshness and Breaker legality by a standard `playState` induction) and the packaging
against the board's byte-identical `Model` (already vendored here as `Snaky.PlaneModel`).
