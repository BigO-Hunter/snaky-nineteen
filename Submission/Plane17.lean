# G2 instantiation: the 17×17 card table wins on the open plane

The same 1,738-card table (Nándor Sieben's 20-move proof sequence, converted to cards and
kernel-checked as `Snaky.Gen17`) that proves `snaky_wins_17x17_in_20` proves the *plane* win:
the board-fit and counting conjuncts of `rootOK` were the only 17×17-specific hypotheses, and
`Snaky.Plane.planeRootOK_of_rootOK` drops them.
